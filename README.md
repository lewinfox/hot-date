# Hot Date

A group scheduling app for finding shared availability. Users create events,
share a link, and participants mark which dates work for them. A heatmap shows
overlapping availability to help the group find the best time.

## Architecture

The server runs Express and serves the Vite dev server (with HMR) in
development, or static files from `dist/public/` in production. The API is under
`/api/`; all other paths fall through to the SPA.

The database schema lives in `shared/schema.ts` and is shared across client and
server for type safety. Path aliases `@/*` (client source) and `@shared/*`
(shared/) are configured in both tsconfig and Vite.

On startup the server automatically applies any pending migrations from the
`migrations/` folder using Drizzle's `migrate()`, creating the database file if
it doesn't exist yet.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path                             | Description                                                 |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/events`                    | Create an event                                             |
| `GET`  | `/api/events/:slug`              | Fetch event + all participants + availabilities             |
| `POST` | `/api/events/:slug/participants` | Add or update a participant's availability (upsert by name) |

### Database Schema

- **events** — title, description, start/end dates, auto-generated slug
- **participants** — name, linked to an event
- **availabilities** — per-participant, per-date entries with type: `all_day` | `morning` | `afternoon`

## Running Locally

You need Node.js 20+. No separate database process is required.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app is available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). The
SQLite database file is created at `./data/hot-date.db` on first run.

## Deployment

### Docker (prebuilt image)

The quickest way to self-host is to pull the prebuilt image from the GitHub
Container Registry:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name hot-date \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v hot-date-data:/data \
  -e DATABASE_PATH=/data/hot-date.db \
  ghcr.io/lewinfox/hot-date:latest
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

To keep the container running across reboots, add `--restart unless-stopped`.

#### Using Docker Compose

Save the following as `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker compose up -d`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/lewinfox/hot-date:latest
    ports:
      - '5000:5000'
    volumes:
      - db_data:/data
    environment:
      DATABASE_PATH: /data/hot-date.db
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  db_data:
```

#### Persistent data

The SQLite database is stored in the `/data` directory inside the container.
Mount a volume there (as shown above) to keep your data when the container is
updated or recreated.

### Building from source

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Changing the Database Schema

1. Edit `shared/schema.ts`
2. Generate a migration file:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

This diffs your schema against the previous state and writes a new SQL file to
`migrations/` (e.g. `0001_....sql`).

3. Commit both the schema change and the new migration file.

On next startup (dev or production), `migrate()` will automatically apply the
new migration.

> Note: migrations only run forward. To undo a change, write a new migration
> that reverses it.

## Environment Variables

| Variable             | Default              | Description                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_PATH`      | `./data/hot-date.db` | Path to the SQLite database file                                          |
| `EVENT_CLEANUP_DAYS` | `30`                 | Delete events this many days after their end date (set to `0` to disable) |
| `NODE_ENV`           | —                    | Set to `development` or `production`                                      |
| `PORT`               | `5000`               | Port the server listens on                                                |

## Scripts

| Script                | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`         | Start the development server                       |
| `npm run build`       | Bundle client + server for production              |
| `npm start`           | Run the production build                           |
| `npm run check`       | TypeScript type checking                           |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate a migration file from schema changes      |
| `npm run db:push`     | Directly push schema to DB (useful in development) |
